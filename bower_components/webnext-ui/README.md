webnext-ui
==========

A UI framework for my WebNext website templates

The goal/purpose of this project is to create a UI framework for web projects similar to bootstrap, foundation and the like, but without much of the bulk. As such, this project will mostly stick to UI elements like typography & buttons. It's goal is more to make having a unified style across a site and building upon it easier.

## Status
~~Not ready for production. still in heavy development (look there's nothing here!)~~

Finally Usable! (Very) Basic functionality (Typography & Buttons) is now available. Documentation coming "soon" (aka probably not soon)
